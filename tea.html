                Tea is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot 
                or boiling water over cured or fresh leaves of Camellia 
                sinensis, an evergreen shrub native to East Asia which 
                probably originated in the borderlands of southwestern 
                China and northern Myanmar. Tea is also rarely made from 
                the leaves of Camellia taliensis. After plain water, tea 
                is the most widely consumed drink in the world.[9] There 
                are many different types of tea; some have a cooling, 
                slightly bitter, and astringent flavour,[10] while others 
                have vastly different profiles that include sweet, nutty, 
                floral, or grassy notes. Tea has a stimulating effect in 
                humans primarily due to its caffeine content.<br>

                You must have heard of black tea and green tea. Add some 
                lemon juice to it and what you get is a drink with immense 
                benefits. Lemon tea has been around for a long time and has 
                gained more popularity due to its health benefits.Lemon tea 
                is prepared using black tea or green tea and by adding the 
                right amount of lemon juice to it. When you add lemon juice 
                to your tea, it changes the colour of tea. This effect is 
                known as the bathochromic shift, and it also changes the 
                taste of the tea. This unique taste makes it a wonderful 
                cup of drink.Drinking hot lemon tea first thing in the 
                morning has become very popular these days. It is one of 
                the best things to start your mornings with. <br>

                Green tea is a type of tea that is made from Camellia 
                sinensis leaves and buds that have not undergone the 
                same withering and oxidation process which is used to 
                make oolong teas and black teas. Green tea originated 
                in China, and since then its production and manufacture 
                has spread to other countries in East Asia. 
                Several varieties of green tea exist, which differ 
                substantially based on the variety of C. 
                Sinensis used, growing conditions, horticultural methods, 
                production processing, and time of harvest. <br>

                Masala chai also known simply as chai, is an Indian beverage popular
                throughout South Asia. Chai is made by brewing black tea 
                in milk and water and then sweetening with sugar. While 
                some variants may also include the addition of aromatic 
                herbs and spices, known colloquially as Masala chai, the 
                most common preparation is unspiced.The term chai originated 
                from the Hindi word, chai (चाय), which was derived from the 
                Chinese word for tea, cha (see Etymology of tea). In English, 
                this spiced tea is commonly referred to as masala chai, or simply 
                chai, even though the term refers to tea in general in the original language.<br>
