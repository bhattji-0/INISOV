                Espresso is a coffee-brewing method of 
                Italian origin,[1] in which a small amount
                of nearly boiling water is forced under 9–10
                bars (900–1,000 kPa; 130–150 psi) of pressure 
                through finely-ground coffee beans. Espresso 
                can be made with a wide variety of coffee beans 
                and roast degrees. Espresso is the most common 
                way of making coffee in southern Europe, especially 
                in Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal. It is also 
                popular in Switzerland, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
                Bulgaria, Greece, South Africa, the United Kingdom, 
                the United States, Canada, Chile, Brazil, Australia 
                and New Zealand..<br>

                    An americano is quite simply just hot water and 
                    espresso. It’ll either be served 1/2 and 1/2 or 
                    1/3 espresso to 2/3 water, depending on the coffee 
                    shop in question or how you’ve chosen to brew it. 
                    There is dispute about whether the espresso or the 
                    water should be added first, but in the case of the 
                    americano, espresso should always be added first as 
                    the crema mixes in and creates a more mellow, even taste.
                    But some people may add it depending on their personal 
                    preference. Whilst most other espresso-based coffee drinks
                    include milk, such as the cappuccino or latte, the 
                    americano stands out amongst them.<br>

                        A cappuccino is an espresso-based coffee drink and is 
                        traditionally prepared with steamed milk foam (microfoam).
                        Variations of the drink involve the use of cream instead of 
                        milk, using non-dairy milk substitutes and flavoring with 
                        cinnamon or chocolate powder.It is typically smaller in 
                        volume than a caffè latte, with a thicker layer of microfoam. 
                        The name comes from the Capuchin friars, referring to the colour 
                        of their habits, and in this context referring to the colour of 
                        the beverage when milk is added in small portion to dark, brewed 
                        coffee (today mostly espresso). The physical appearance of a modern 
                        cappuccino with espresso créma and steamed milk is a result of a 
                        long evolution of the drink.<br>

                            A Caffè latte, often shortened to just latte in English, 
                            is a coffee drink of Italian origin made with espresso and 
                            steamed milk. Variants include the chocolate-flavored mocha 
                            or replacing the coffee with another beverage base such as 
                            masala chai (spiced Indian tea), mate, matcha, turmeric or rooibos; 
                            alternatives to milk, such as soy milk or almond milk, are also used.
                            In France, cafè latte is from the original name of the beverage 
                            (caffè latte); a combination of  espresso and steamed milk equivalent 
                            to a "latte" is in French called grand crème and in German Milchkaffee.<br>

                                 Filter coffee is a coffee drink made by mixing hot milk 
                                 and sugar with the infusion obtained by percolation brewing
                                 of finely ground coffee powder with chicory in a traditional 
                                 Indian filter. It has been described as "hot, strong, sweet and 
                                 topped with bubbly froth" and is known as filter kaapi in India.
                                 Filter coffee is made with Plantation A washed arabica or Peaberry 
                                 coffee beans. The beans are dark roasted, ground, and blended with 
                                 chicory, with the coffee constituting 80-90% and the chicory 10-20% 
                                 of the mixture. The chicory's slight bitterness contributes to the 
                                 flavor of Indian filter coffee.<br>
